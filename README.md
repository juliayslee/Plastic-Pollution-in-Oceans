# Plastic-Pollution-in-Oceans

My motivation for this project is to educate individuals with factual results about the immense plastic pollution in our oceans/waters today. 

### Notes on dataset columns:		

- Economic Status (Based upon 2010 Gross National Income):
Low income country (LIC)
Lower middle income country (LMC)
Upper middle income country (UMC)
High income country (HIC))

- Coastal Population (Based upon a 50 km coastal buffer)

- Waste Generation Rate: kg/person/day, estimating all solid waste discarded by residents, commercial, etc. 

- Percent Plastic in Waste Stream: Plastic portion of entire waste stream. A waste stream is the complete flow of waste from domestic or industrial areas through to final disposal

- Percent Inadequately Managed Waste: All waste inadequately disposed of includes uncontrolled landfills, dumps that are not managed and uncontained. This leads to a higher risk in ending up in water/oceans.

- Waste management (or waste disposal) are the activities and actions required to manage waste from its inception to its final disposal.[1]This includes the collection, transport, treatment and disposal of waste, together with monitoring and regulation of the waste management process. This does not include 'littered' plastic waste, which is approximately 2% of total waste (including high-income countries).

- Percent Littered Waste: Consists of waste products that have been disposed of improperly, without consent, at an undesirable location.

- Plastic Waste Generation Rate: kg/day, estimating all plastic waste discarded by residents, commercial, etc.

- Inadequately Managed Plastic Waste: All plastic waste inadequately disposed of includes uncontrolled landfills, dumps that are not managed and uncontained. This leads to a higher risk in ending up in water/oceans.

- Plastic Waste Littered: Consists of plastic products that have been disposed of improperly, without consent, at an undesirable location.

- Mismanaged Plastic Waste 2010 – Only Plastic Mismanaged waste is material which is at high risk of entering the ocean via wind or tidal transport, or carried to coastlines from inland waterways. Mismanaged waste is the sum of material which is either littered or inadequately disposed.

- Mismanaged Plastic Waste in 2025 – Only Plastic Mismanaged waste is material which is at high risk of entering the ocean via wind or tidal transport, or carried to coastlines from inland waterways. Mismanaged waste is the sum of material which is either littered or inadequately disposed.
