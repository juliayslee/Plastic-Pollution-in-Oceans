# How much waste do Humans Generate?

## Introduction
It's no surprise that we are our own worst enemy when it comes to climate change and waste generation. With unlawful litterers to mismanaged waste, everyone plays a part in the immense amount of waste generated on our earth today. But how much are we really talking? Let's look at the numbers.

# Part 1: How much waste is generated per year worldwide? 
Let's take a look at the amount of waste generated per year worldwide and per country.
Waste generation per day worldwide is 2,459,811,244 kg in 2010.

In 2010, the United States of America generated the most waste with 291,346,588 kg/day. Second coming from China with 289,181,626 kg/day. The United States was/is considered a "High Income" country where as China was/is considered a "Upper Middle Income" country.

Looking at Plastic Waste Generation, we see minimal change in the Top 10 countries producing the most plastic waste. With the United States at the top, and China second.

What about the Top 10 lowest waste generating countries?

Coming in at the bottom is the country of Tokelau, which was/is considered a "Low Middle Income" country. What should be noted is the population difference between the Top 10 highest and Top 10 lowest. The United States has a coastal population of 112,925,034 where as Tokelau only 1,379 coastal population.

# Part 2: Waste Generation Rate?
As noted above, Tokelau has a significantly lower coastal population compared to United States, and the other highest waste generating countries. A waste generation rate per person will give us a better idea of how an individual affects this number.

Here, actually Mozambique (Low Income Country) has the lowest waste generation per person per day at only 0.14kg/person/day. This is a better indication of how much waste an individual generates. Note that Tokelau is not on this list.

# Part 3: Do Countries with a Certain Economic Status Produce more Waste?

About 40% (74) of the countries in 2010 were considered "High Income" countries. By 2019, this number increased from 74 to 81 countries. Do these countries produce more or less waste than lower income countries?

The bar graph above shows the waste generation of countries by economic status, with the red line being the global average of about 12,811,517 kg/day. We see that "High Income" and "Upper Middle Income" countries are above this line, and "Lower Middle Income" and "Low Income" countries are well below.

Above is a rate per person per day of the amount of waste generated by economic status. Following the same trend as Average Waste Generation of Countries by Economic Status, "High Income" countries are above the global average (1.64 kg/person/day), where "Upper Middle Income", "Lower Middle Income" and "Low Income" countries fall below.

# Conclusion
